    <p>I have worn a lot of hats in my professional career</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Actor (Highlights: Arthur the Aardvark)</li>
        <li>Educator (If you went to school in central NJ and the Boston metro area, I could have been to your school to do an assembly on bullying.</li>
        <li>Pedicab Driver (Simpler times... sigh)</li>
        <li>Personal Trainer/Wellness Coach</li>
        <li>...the list goes on...</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All of my experience has revolved around communicating with people to facilitate something new (even Pedicabbing! If you needed to get to Fenway Park quickly, nothing will beat a Pedicab.). I have learned a lot in my circuitous route, and the next step in my journey is <strong>Software Engineering</strong> where I can communicate with even more people at once using a dynamic platform. Welcome to the first step of the next step my journey!</p>
