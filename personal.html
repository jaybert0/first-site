    <h3>Up or down the mountain | Eater of delicious things | Drinker of heady beers | Can I bring my dog?</h3> 
      <p>My happy place is always in the mountains, whether it be hiking up them, or skiing down them. This is usually followed up at a new brewery
          in some farm warehouse that also has a delicious menu, and then sitting next to the fire with my wife, Penny, and our dog, Reece, with a 
          juicy New England IPA. 
          <br>
          Some of my other passions are discovering new foods (usually Asian in variety), rock climbing, biking, and exploring brownstone Brooklyn 
          looking for whatever people happen to be leaving out to give away (stooping as we refer to it, and it's surprisingly fun seeing what you 
          can find). I spend way too much time on my sports fanaticism (Go BC Eagles/Green Bay Packers/Boston Red Sox/Milwaukee Bucks!), and have 
          invested FAR too much time on my campaign in Gloomhaven to stop now!!! I've also invested way too much money on other board games too.
          <br>
          I will ask you if Reece, our dog can join us. She's our amazing Australian Shepherd/Lab Mix that we rescued thanks to <a href="https://badassbrooklyn.com">Badass Brooklyn Animal Rescue</a>. 
          Their slogan is "Saving badass dogs from idiot humans." We vibe with them.
