    <h3>Wisconsin-born | Connecticut-raised | Boston-educated | Brooklyn-loved</h3> 
      <p>After being born outside of Milwaukee, Wisconsin (of all places!), this Korean-American kid grew up in Connecticut, before shipping up to Boston to attend <a href="https://www.bc.edu">Boston College</a> where I received my BAs in Secondary Education and Mathematics, and my MA in Educational Research. I got bit hard by the acting bug and had the chance to travel around the US and also Japan as part of an educational theatre company, before accepting an Acting Apprenticeship at <a href="https://www.actorstheatre.org">Actors of Louisville</a>. I ultimately ended up in NYC, and specifically found a home in Brooklyn, and over 15 years later have not left. Acting gave way to Personal Training, and Personal Training into Wellness Coaching where I believe in a deliberate scientific-based approach focusing on coaching lifestyle habits to support an injury-prevention based movement program. I now find myself in <strong>Software Engineering</strong> wanting to bring my 14-years in the fitness/wellness industry to even more people through technology.</p>
